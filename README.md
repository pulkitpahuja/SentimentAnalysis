Sentiment Analysis using Keras,Tensorflow and spacy using the IMDB dataset

A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect levelâ€”whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, "beyond polarity" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as "angry", "sad", and "happy".

Sentiment Analysis is the most common text classification tool that analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative our neutral. 
You can input a sentence of your choice and gauge the underlying sentiment.

Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor). 

Here the IMDB reviews dataset is used for the negative and the positive response.
